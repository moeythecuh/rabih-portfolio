          <li>How? 
            <br/>
            After going through a difficult year of shocks and setbacks, I wanted to change the dynamics of my life, so I created a habit program and stuck by it for a year now, it changed my life by every stretch of the imagination.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Why?
            <br/>
            After studying the psychology of habit building, I decided it was enough to gatekeep the process that changed my life and decided to tutor young men and women in order to help them become the best version they aspire to become.
