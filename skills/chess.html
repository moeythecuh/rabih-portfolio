  <h1>Chess</h1>
  <p>Although it's a hobby, I can't deny that chess played a crucial part in improving :
    <ul>
      <li>My Memory</li>
      <li>My Capacity to Analyze</li>
      <li>My Decision-making process</li>
      <li>My self-accountability</li>
      <li>My Intuition</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Not to forget, I recently reached 1100+ Elo rating (Intermediate Level) during 9 months of playing.</p>
